# Structured meshing of arterial trees

This code provide several tools to work with arterial network: 

- A data structure based on spatial graph that can be used to visualize and edit vascular trees
- A parametric modeling framework
- A meshing method to obtain high quality hexahedral surface and volume mesh
- A set of functions to interact with numerical simulation tool OpenFoam for computational fluid dynamics

It is divided in four main classes:

**Nfurcation**:

**ArterialTree**:

**Spline**:

**Model**:

**Simulation**:


*Install the required python3 packages: numpy, pyvista, matplotlib, math, goemdl, networkx, scipy.spatial*
